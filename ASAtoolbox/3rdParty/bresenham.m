function [x y]=bresenham(x1,y1,x2,y2)

%Matlab optmized version of Bresenham line algorithm. No loops.
%Format:
%               [x y]=bham(x1,y1,x2,y2)
%
%Input:
%               (x1,y1): Start position
%               (x2,y2): End position
%
%Output:
%               x y: the line coordinates from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2)
%
%Usage example:
%               [x y]=bham(1,1, 10,-5);
%               plot(x,y,'or');
